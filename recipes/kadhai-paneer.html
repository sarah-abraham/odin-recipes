    Kadai masala is a unique blend of spices specially used to make kadai dishes. It is much more flavourful and
    stronger than the regular garam masala that is used in regular Indian cooking. Kadai masala is made with
    coriander seeds, red chilies, cloves, cardamoms, cinnamon & fennel seeds.
    These whole spices are dry roasted to bring out the aroma and then ground to a slightly coarse powder.
    Here coriander seeds are used in higher quantity than it is used for the regular garam masala. So if you do not
    have all of these spices, then the simple trick is to use coriander seeds, red chilies & garam masala.
    Since most garam masala powders already have cinnamon, cloves, cardamoms and fennel seeds, sometimes I
    go the easy way and use coriander seeds, red chilies & garam masala.

  <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup paneer</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons coriander seeds</li>
    <li>1 to 2 Kashmiri deseeded dried red chilies</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>2 to 3 green cardamoms</li>
    <li>2 cloves</li>
    <li>¼ inch very small piece of cinnamon</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Directions: </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Rinse tomatoes & bell peppers. Chop tomatoes very finely. Alternately you can puree the tomatoes and use.
        Make a fine paste of ginger and garlic or grate them. Cube paneer and bell peppers to ¾ inch pieces. Set aside. If you want to use onion, you can fine chop 1 medium onion.</li>
    <li> Add 1 tablespoon coriander seeds and 2 to 3 dried red chilies to a pan and toast them until crisp on a low heat. When the red chilies turn crisp remove to a plate and cool them. To the same pan add ¾ teaspoon fennel
    seeds and roast on a medium heat until aromatic. Remove these as well to the same plate and cool them completely. </li>
    <li>  Make a fine powder and set aside. </li>
    <li>  Pour 2 tablespoons oil to the kadai and heat it. When the oil turns hot, add 1½ teaspoon ginger garlic paste. Saute on a medium heat until the ginger garlic turns aromatic. Do not burn them</li>
    <li> Allow kadai paneer to rest in the pan covered for 10 to 20 mins so the paneer absorbs all of the flavors of kadai masala. Serve with roti, plain parathas or stuff it in your sandwich.</li>
